Language:

File to translate: https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/sit-rep_XX/narratives/ncov_sit-rep_XX_2020-XX-XX.md

You can translate directly in this file, but please remember to push often as other people may be working on the translation! You should have access to push directly to the branch, so there’s no need to create a pull request.

Note that this file is in Markdown. In general, it is important not to change any formatting or links. (Although it is okay to update Wikipedia or CDC links to the appropriate language version.) Comments to help with translation are noted in comment symbols like <! -- Comment -->.

Please add your name under `translators:` with a tab, dash, and new line, formatted just like authors are. Please also add a link to your professional page (can use Twitter) under `translatorLinks:`.

After the report is translated and proofread, we’ll publish it to https://nextstrain.org/ and post on Twitter. Please share the report with your colleagues, so we can get the information out there!

Note: You may know of other great resources available in your language; please don’t add them to the situation report. We need to keep content the same across all translations, so we can be confident in the accuracy of what we publish. Because Nextstrain team members only speak so many languages, this is our best system for doing so. Thanks for understanding.

Thank you so very much for the excellent translations; it’s a pleasure to work with you! We hope you and your loved ones are well.
